## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Remote - Containers extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Quickstart

- Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/0yik/odoo-devcontainer.git
```
- Open the project in VSCode.
- Run the Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container... command from the Command Palette (F1) or quick actions Status bar item, and select the project folder odoo-devcontainer.
- The VS Code window will reload and start building the dev container. A progress notification provides status updates. You only have to build a dev container the first time you open it; opening the folder after the first successful build will be much quicker.
- After the build completes, VS Code will automatically connect to the container.
